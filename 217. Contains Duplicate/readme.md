## Intuitive Explanation:

### Algorithm:

1. **Initialize Data Structure:** Create an empty set or hashmap to store unique elements encountered so far. This data structure efficiently handles uniqueness checks due to its inherent property of rejecting duplicates.

2. **Iterate through the List:**
   - For each element in the list:
     - **Check for Duplication:** If the element already exists in the set or hashmap, it's a duplicate. Return True immediately, signaling that duplicates have been found.
     - **Add to Unique Elements:** If the element is not found (not a duplicate), add it to the set or hashmap to track it as potentially unique.

3. **No Duplicates Found:** If the entire list is iterated through without returning True, it means no duplicates were encountered. Return False to indicate a unique list.
