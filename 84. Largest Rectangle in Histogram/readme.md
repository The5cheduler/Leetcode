## Problem Statement
Given an array of integers `heights` representing the heights of bars in a histogram, find the area of the largest rectangle that can be formed from the bars.

## Algorithm Explanation

### Step 1: Initialization
```python
maxArea = 0
stack = []
```
Initialize `maxArea` to 0 to keep track of the maximum area found so far. Create an empty stack `stack` to store tuples of indices and heights of bars.

### Step 2: Iterating through the Heights
```python
for index, height in enumerate(heights):
    start = index
    while stack and stack[-1][1] > height:
        index_popped, height_popped = stack.pop()
        maxArea = max(maxArea, height_popped * (index - index_popped))
        start = index_popped
    stack.append((start, height))
```
Iterate through each index and height in the `heights` list. For each bar, check if the stack is not empty and if the height of the current bar is less than the height of the bar at the top of the stack. If so, pop bars from the stack and calculate the area of the rectangle formed by each popped bar. Update `maxArea` if a larger area is found. Push the current index and height onto the stack.

### Step 3: Processing Remaining Bars in the Stack
```python
for i, h in stack:
    maxArea = max(maxArea, h * (len(heights) - i))
```
Process the remaining bars in the stack. Each remaining bar represents a rectangle with width equal to the number of bars remaining to the right of it. Calculate the area of each rectangle and update `maxArea` if a larger area is found.

### Step 4: Return Maximum Area
```python
return maxArea
```
Return the maximum area found.

## Conclusion
The solution employs a stack-based approach to efficiently find the largest rectangular area in a histogram. By iterating through the bars and maintaining a stack of bars in non-decreasing order of height, the algorithm efficiently identifies the largest rectangle that can be formed.
