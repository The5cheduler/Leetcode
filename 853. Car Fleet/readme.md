**Key Insights**
- 🚗 Car fleets on a single lane road cannot pass each other, leading to interesting collision scenarios.
- 📈 Visualizing the problem using linear equations and drawings helps understand the concept and identify fleet collisions.
- ⏱️ The algorithm for solving the car fleet problem involves iterating through the cars in reverse order and comparing their arrival times.
- 🧮 Calculating arrival times and removing cars from the stack based on collisions determines the number of car fleets.
- 📚 The overall time complexity of the algorithm is O(n log n) due to sorting, while the extra space complexity is O(n) for the stack and array.
- 💻 Implementing the algorithm in code involves creating an array of pairs, sorting it, and using a stack to track car fleets.
- 🏁 The number of car fleets at the end of the algorithm can be determined by the length of the stack.
