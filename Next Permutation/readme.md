# Next Permutation Algorithm

The given Python code implements the "Next Permutation" algorithm, which is used to generate the lexicographically next greater permutation of a list of numbers. This algorithm is used to rearrange the elements of the list into the next greater permutation, considering the order defined by the natural ordering of the elements.

## Function Signature

```python
def nextPermutation(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:
```

- **Input**: `nums` is a list of integers representing the original permutation.
- **Output**: The function does not return anything but modifies the `nums` list in place to represent the next permutation.

## Algorithm Explanation

1. First, the algorithm initializes an `index` variable to -1. This `index` variable will be used to keep track of the position in the list where the next permutation will be generated.

2. It also calculates the length of the input list `nums` and stores it in the `n` variable.

3. The algorithm then searches for the first index `i` from the right side of the list such that `nums[i] < nums[i+1]`. This is done by looping from `n-2` to 0 in reverse order. If such an index `i` is found, it means the list can be permuted to create a greater permutation.

4. If `index` remains -1 after the previous step, it means the input list is already in non-increasing order, and it represents the last permutation. In this case, the algorithm reverses the list `nums` in place using slicing (`nums[:] = nums[::-1]`), effectively creating the first permutation.

5. If `index` is not -1, the algorithm proceeds to find the element in the list that is just greater than the element at index `index`. It does this by looping from the end of the list (index `n-1`) towards the `index` position. When it finds such an element, it swaps it with the element at the `index` position.

6. Finally, to generate the next greater permutation, the algorithm reverses the elements from index `index+1` to the end of the list.

## Example

Let's walk through an example using the input list `nums = [3, 2, 1]`:

1. Initialize `index = -1` and `n = 3`.

2. The first loop starts with `i = 1`. Since `nums[1] = 2` and `nums[1+1] = 1`, the condition `nums[i] < nums[i+1]` is not satisfied. The loop continues.

3. The second loop starts with `i = 0`. Since `nums[0] = 3` and `nums[0+1] = 2`, the condition `nums[i] < nums[i+1]` is satisfied, and `index` is updated to 0.

4. `index` is not -1, so the algorithm proceeds. It searches from the end of the list for the first element greater than `nums[0] = 3`. The element `nums[1] = 2` satisfies this condition.

5. The algorithm swaps `nums[0]` and `nums[1]`, resulting in `nums = [2, 3, 1]`.

6. To generate the next greater permutation, the algorithm reverses the elements from index `1+1` (index 2) to the end of the list. After this step, `nums = [2, 1, 3]`, which is the lexicographically next greater permutation.

## Summary

The Next Permutation algorithm is used to find the lexicographically next greater permutation of a list of integers. It rearranges the elements in place by swapping and reversing to achieve the next permutation efficiently. The algorithm is useful in various scenarios where it's necessary to generate permutations in a specific order, such as combinatorial optimization problems and generating all possible permutations of a set of elements.
