## Finding the Median of Two Sorted Arrays

This markdown file explains each step taken in the provided code for finding the median of two sorted arrays:

**1. Function Definition and Comments:**

```markdown
class Solution:
    def findMedianSortedArrays(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> float:
        """
        Finds the median of two sorted arrays.

        Args:
            nums1: The first sorted list of integers.
            nums2: The second sorted list of integers.

        Returns:
            The median of the combined sorted array.
        """
```

- This defines a class `Solution` with a method `findMedianSortedArrays` that takes two sorted lists of integers as input and returns the median of their combined sorted array.
- The docstring explains the function's purpose, arguments, and return value.

**2. Variable Assignment:**

```markdown
n1_length, n2_length = len(nums1), len(nums2)
```

- Stores the lengths of both input lists in separate variables for better readability.

**3. Ensure Shorter List First:**

```markdown
if n1_length > n2_length:
    return self.findMedianSortedArrays(nums2, nums1)
```

- Checks if the first list is longer than the second. If so, recursively calls the function with the shorter list first, optimizing the search space.

**4. Calculate Total Elements and Half:**

```markdown
total_elements = n1_length + n2_length
left = (n1_length + n2_length + 1) // 2
```

- Calculates the total number of elements in the combined list and the index of the median element (considering even/odd cases).

**5. Initialize Binary Search:**

```markdown
low, high = 0, n1_length
```

- Sets up the binary search bounds: `low` is the minimum index to consider for the first list's element contributing to the median, and `high` is the maximum valid index.

**6. Binary Search Loop:**

```markdown
while low <= high:
    # Calculate indices for potential median elements in both lists
    index_a = (low + high) // 2
    index_b = left - index_a

    # Handle potential out-of-bounds cases with infinity
    # ... (see code for details)

    # Check if potential median elements are in correct positions
    if nums1_left <= nums2_right and nums2_left <= nums1_right:
        # Calculate median based on odd or even number of elements
        # ... (see code for details)

    elif nums1_left > nums2_right:  # Adjust search space towards smaller elements
        high = index_a - 1
    else:  # Adjust search space towards larger elements
        low = index_a + 1
```

- The loop iterates until the correct median element(s) are found.
- Inside the loop:
    - `index_a` and `index_b` are calculated based on the current search space.
    - Handles potential out-of-bounds accesses using negative infinity and positive infinity.
    - Checks if the elements at `index_a` and `index_b` are potential median elements (based on surrounding elements).
    - If found, calculates the median based on the total number of elements being even or odd.
    - Otherwise, adjusts the search space (`low` or `high`) based on the comparison result.

**7. Placeholder Return (Optional):**

```markdown
return 0  # Replace with actual return value
```

- This placeholder is likely present for testing purposes and should be replaced with the calculated median value in the actual implementation.

This markdown file provides a step-by-step explanation of the code, making it easier to understand the logic and purpose of each section. Remember to replace the placeholder return value with the actual median calculation based on the chosen approach.
