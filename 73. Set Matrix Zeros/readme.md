# Intuition
The problem requires us to modify a given matrix in-place by setting all rows and columns to zero if any element in that row or column is zero. To solve this problem efficiently, we can use two variables `col_zero` and `row_zero` to keep track of whether the first column and the first row need to be set to zero.

# Approach
Here's the approach to solve the problem:

1. Initialize two boolean variables `col_zero` and `row_zero` to False, which will be used to keep track of whether the first column and the first row need to be set to zero.

2. Check if the first column has any zero element:
   - Traverse through each row of the matrix.
   - If any element in the first column is zero, set the `col_zero` variable to True, indicating that the first column needs to be set to zero.

3. Check if the first row has any zero element:
   - Traverse through each column of the matrix.
   - If any element in the first row is zero, set the `row_zero` variable to True, indicating that the first row needs to be set to zero.

4. Mark the corresponding rows and columns as zero:
   - Traverse through the matrix starting from the second row and the second column (index 1, 1).
   - If an element at position `matrix[i][j]` is zero, set the corresponding elements in the first row and the first column (i.e., `matrix[i][0]` and `matrix[0][j]`) to zero, indicating that this row and column need to be set to zero later.

5. Set the marked rows and columns to zero:
   - Traverse through the matrix starting from the second row and the second column (index 1, 1).
   - If either `matrix[i][0]` or `matrix[0][j]` is zero, set the element `matrix[i][j]` to zero.

6. Finally, if `row_zero` is True, set the entire first row to zero.

7. Also, if `col_zero` is True, set the entire first column to zero.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(m * n), where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns in the matrix. We traverse through the matrix twice, once to mark the rows and columns to be set to zero and once to actually set the elements to zero.
- Space complexity: O(1), as we are using only a constant amount of extra space to store `col_zero` and `row_zero`, and we are modifying the input matrix in-place without using any additional data structures.
